```ruby
gem 'pokemon-sinatra-project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pokemon-sinatra-project

## Usage

All you have to do is run `rake db:migrate` to integrate the database. Then you need to run shotgun. Got to the server listed and you can sign in, create an account and keep track of all your pokemon. It lets you edit, delete and see other peoples list of pokemon they have.

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
